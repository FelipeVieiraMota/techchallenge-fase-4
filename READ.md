# Project API Documentation

Welcome to the API documentation for this project. Below, you'll find details on how to access and interact with the available API services.

## Available API Endpoints

Each API instance runs on a different port. You can access their Swagger UI interfaces using the links below:

- [API 1 - Swagger UI](http://localhost:8085/swagger-ui/index.html)
- [API 2 - Swagger UI](http://localhost:8084/swagger-ui/index.html)
- [API 3 - Swagger UI](http://localhost:8082/swagger-ui/index.html)
- [API 4 - Swagger UI](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html)

## How to Use the API

1. **Start the services**
   Ensure all required services are running so that the APIs can be accessed.

2. **Access the Swagger UI**
